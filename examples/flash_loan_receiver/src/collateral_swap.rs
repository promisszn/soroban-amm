//! Collateral swap / Liquidity migration strategy.
//!
//! ## Use case
//!
//! An LP holds LP tokens from an old pool version and wants to migrate to a
//! new version without exposing themselves to price movement. Using a flash loan:
//!
//! 1. Borrow the underlying tokens from the new pool
//! 2. Mint new LP tokens in the new pool with the borrowed collateral
//! 3. Burn old LP tokens to reclaim the original capital from the old pool
//! 4. Repay the new pool's flash loan with part of the reclaimed capital
//! 5. Keep the proceeds in the new pool's LP tokens
//!
//! This atomic operation lets the LP switch pool versions without risking
//! intermediate exposure to spot price.
//!
//! ## Economics
//!
//! **Cost:**
//! - Flash loan fee on borrowed amounts (typically 0.1-0.5 bps)
//! - Slippage on LP operations (add/remove) if the pools are not perfectly liquid
//!
//! **Benefit:**
//! - No intermediate price exposure
//! - Atomic pool migration
//! - LP position restructuring without losing concentration (if migrating within CL)
