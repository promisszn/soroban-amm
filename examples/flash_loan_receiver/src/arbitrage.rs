//! Arbitrage strategy: borrow tokens, trade them at a better price, repay the loan.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! Suppose pool A trades token X for token Y at price 1.0 (1 X = 1 Y), but
//! pool B trades them at price 0.95 (1 X = 0.95 Y, meaning X is cheaper at B).
//!
//! An arbitrageur can:
//! 1. Flash borrow 1000 X from pool A
//! 2. Sell those 1000 X on pool B, receiving ~950 Y
//! 3. Use 1000 Y of that to cover the principal owed to pool A
//! 4. Pocket the ~50 Y difference (minus flash loan fee)
//!
//! If the price difference closes before the strategy executes (e.g., another
//! arbitrageur got there first), the strategy must detect this and abort cleanly
//! rather than losing money.
//!
//! ## Economics
//!
//! **Profit formula:**
//!
//! ```text
//! profit = (amount_in / spot_price_worse) * spot_price_better - amount_in - flash_loan_fee
//! ```
//!
//! Where:
//! - `amount_in`: Size of the arbitrage (e.g., 1000 tokens)
//! - `spot_price_worse`: Price at the worse market (where we trade)
//! - `spot_price_better`: Price at the better market (where we borrow)
//! - `flash_loan_fee`: Fee charged by the pool (typically 0.1-0.5 bps)
//!
//! The arbitrage is profitable only if the profit is strictly positive.
//! Real arbitrage typically runs on microsecond timescales; a slow receiver
//! implementation may miss the window.
