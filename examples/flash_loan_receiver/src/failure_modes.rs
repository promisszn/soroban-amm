//! Educational guide to flash loan failure modes.
//!
//! This module documents common mistakes that lead to lost funds or reverted
//! transactions when working with flash loans. These are pseudo-code examples
//! showing the PATTERN to avoid, not compilable contracts.
//!
//! ## Failure modes covered
//!
//! 1. **Insufficient profit**: Borrow, attempt a trade that doesn't profit enough
//!    to cover the fee. The receiver detects this and returns `false`, causing
//!    the entire transaction to revert. The pool is unharmed.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // Borrower: Okay, I borrowed 100 XLM, fee is 5 XLM.
//!    // I traded for 102 XLM elsewhere but costs 5 XLM to do.
//!    // Net = 102 - 105 = -3 XLM loss, so return false.
//!    if profit < fee {
//!        return false; // Revert entire flash loan
//!    }
//!    ```
//!
//! 2. **Reentrancy attempt**: Try to call the pool during the flash loan callback.
//!    The pool's reentrancy guard rejects this immediately with `Reentrant` error.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // During callback, attempting to call pool again:
//!    let price = pool.get_price();  // ❌ ERROR: Reentrant!
//!    ```
//!
//! 3. **Incomplete repayment**: Repay the principal but not the fee. The pool's
//!    balance check fails before the callback returns, reverting the transaction.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // Borrowed 100, fee 5, but only repay 100:
//!    token.transfer(&pool, 100);  // ❌ Pool expects 105
//!    ```
//!
//! 4. **Wrong recipient**: Repay to an address other than the pool. The pool does
//!    not receive the funds and reverts.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // Repay to wrong address:
//!    token.transfer(&wrong_addr, 105);  // ❌ Pool not paid
//!    ```
//!
//! ## Common patterns that lead to each failure
//!
//! These are demonstrated below as plain functions rather than deployable
//! `#[contract]` types: a single crate's wasm export table is shared across
//! all contracts it defines, so multiple `on_flash_loan`/`initialize`
//! entry points here would collide with each other and with
//! [`crate::FlashLoanReceiver`].
