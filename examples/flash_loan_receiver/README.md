# Flash Loan Receiver Reference Implementation

A production-ready reference implementation of a Soroban AMM flash loan receiver, demonstrating safe and profitable usage patterns, common pitfalls, and comprehensive testing strategies.

## What is a flash loan?

A flash loan is a loan that is borrowed and repaid within a single atomic transaction. The borrower receives funds, can use them for any purpose, but must return the principal plus a fee before the transaction completes.

**Flow:**

1. Caller invokes `pool.flash_loan(receiver, amount_a, amount_b, data)`
2. Pool transfers tokens to the receiver contract
3. Pool calls `receiver.on_flash_loan(amount_a, amount_b, fee_a, fee_b, data)`
4. Receiver must transfer back `amount_a + fee_a` and `amount_b + fee_b` to the pool
5. Pool verifies repayment
6. Transaction commits (or reverts if repayment incomplete)

Flash loans are powerful for arbitrage, liquidations, and collateral swaps — but require careful implementation. Getting the repayment or reentrancy guard wrong costs all borrowed funds.

## Callback contract guarantees

### What the pool guarantees

- Your `on_flash_loan` is called exactly once
- Token balances are increased before the callback
- The pool does not check repayment until your callback returns
- Reentrancy into the pool is rejected by a guard

### What you must guarantee

- **Before returning**, transfer back to the pool:
    - `amount_a + fee_a` of token A
    - `amount_b + fee_b` of token B
- **Missing the repayment** → entire transaction reverts
- **Partial repayment** → entire transaction reverts
- **Attempting reentrancy** → transaction reverts with error code 14

## Strategies implemented

### Arbitrage

Borrow at one pool, trade at a better price elsewhere, repay the loan.

```
Borrow 1000 X from pool A → Sell at pool B (better price) → Repay pool A + fee → Keep profit
```

**Requirements:**

- Identify price differences between markets
- Execute the counter-trade before the callback returns
- Profit must exceed the flash loan fee, or the entire attempt fails

**File:** [`src/arbitrage.rs`](src/arbitrage.rs)

### Collateral swap / Liquidity migration

Migrate an LP position from one pool to another without intermediate price exposure.

```
Borrow underlying tokens from pool B → Add liquidity to pool B
→ Remove liquidity from pool A → Repay pool B + fee → Profit from structural change
```

**Requirements:**

- Coordinate two or more pool operations atomically
- Ensure repayment is possible from reclaimed collateral
- Handle slippage correctly on both sides

**File:** [`src/collateral_swap.rs`](src/collateral_swap.rs)

## Failure modes demonstrated

Every pitfall is implemented and tested so you can see exactly what happens:

### 1. Insufficient profit aborts cleanly

```rust
fn on_flash_loan(...) -> bool {
    // Check if the opportunity is still profitable
    if profit_bps < fee_bps {
        return false; // Abort; pool reverts the entire flash loan
    }
    // ... continue with profitable trade
}
```

The receiver returns `false`, the pool reverts atomically, and no funds are lost.

**Test:** [`tests/flash_loan_test.rs::insufficient_profit_aborts_cleanly`](tests/flash_loan_test.rs)

### 2. Reentrancy is blocked

```rust
fn on_flash_loan(...) -> bool {
    let pool = Address::generate(&env); // Can't read from storage due to guard
    let client = AmmPoolClient::new(&env, &pool);
    let info = client.get_info(); // <- REJECTED: Reentrant error (code 14)
}
```

The pool's reentrancy guard rejects any pool call during the callback.

**Workaround:** Pass token addresses in the `data` parameter.

**Test:** [`tests/flash_loan_test.rs::reentrancy_attempt_rejected`](tests/flash_loan_test.rs)

### 3. Incomplete repayment reverts

```rust
fn on_flash_loan(env, amount_a, amount_b, fee_a, fee_b, _data) -> bool {
    TokenClient::new(&env, token_a).transfer(
        &receiver,
        &pool,
        &amount_a, // <- WRONG: fee_a is missing!
    );
    true
}
// Pool post-check: balance_after < balance_before + amount + fee
// Result: InsufficientLiquidity error, entire transaction reverts
```

The pool checks total repayment after the callback returns. Shortfall = revert.

**Test:** [`tests/flash_loan_test.rs::incomplete_repayment_reverts`](tests/flash_loan_test.rs)

### 4. Repayment to the wrong address reverts

```rust
fn on_flash_loan(...) -> bool {
    TokenClient::new(&env, token_a).transfer(
        &receiver,
        &wrong_address, // <- Not the pool!
    );
    true
}
// Pool post-check: balance_after < balance_before + amount + fee
// Result: InsufficientLiquidity error, entire transaction reverts
```

The pool checks its own balance, not whether a transfer happened. Send to the wrong
address, the pool doesn't see it, and the transaction reverts.

**Test:** [`tests/flash_loan_test.rs::wrong_recipient_reverts`](tests/flash_loan_test.rs)

## Testing strategy

The test suite in [`tests/flash_loan_test.rs`](tests/flash_loan_test.rs) uses a real Soroban
test environment with actual contracts:

- **No mocks** — every test deploys real AMM and token contracts
- **No network calls** — everything runs in-process with recorded ledger state
- **Recorded state** — ledger timestamp, sequence number, and all balances are deterministic

### Test categories

**Happy path** (10+ tests):

- Repay principal + fee exactly
- Repay both tokens correctly
- Fee accounting is exact across multiple loans
- Token conservation

**Failure modes** (4+ tests):

- Insufficient profit aborts cleanly
- Reentrancy is rejected
- Incomplete repayment reverts
- Wrong recipient reverts

Run the full suite:

```bash
cargo test -p flash_loan_receiver
```

## Deployment guide

### Step 1: Compile to WASM

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32v1-none -p flash_loan_receiver
```

Output: `target/wasm32v1-none/release/flash_loan_receiver.wasm`

### Step 2: Deploy the contract

Using `soroban-cli`:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/flash_loan_receiver.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-key>
```

This returns the contract address.

### Step 3: Initialize the receiver

Call the `initialize` entry point with the pool address:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <receiver-address> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-key> \
  -- initialize \
  --pool <pool-address>
```

### Step 4: Trigger a flash loan

From another contract or off-chain via a transaction envelope:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <pool-address> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-key> \
  -- flash_loan \
  --receiver <receiver-address> \
  --amount_a 1000000 \
  --amount_b 0 \
  --data ""
```

## Fee structure

The pool charges a flash loan fee as a percentage of the borrowed amount:

- **Testnet**: Typically 0.05% (5 basis points)
- **Mainnet**: May vary by pool; check `pool.get_info().flash_loan_fee_bps`

**Example:**

- Borrow 1,000,000 tokens
- Fee: 1,000,000 × 5 / 10,000 = 500 tokens
- Repayment: 1,000,500 tokens

## Reentrancy guard workaround

The pool's reentrancy guard prevents any pool function call during the callback. To work
around this, pass all required data in the `data` parameter:

```rust
fn on_flash_loan(
    env: Env,
    amount_a: i128,
    amount_b: i128,
    fee_a: i128,
    fee_b: i128,
    data: Bytes,
) -> bool {
    // Decode token addresses from `data`
    let (token_a, token_b) = decode_tokens(&data);

    // Now you can repay without calling the pool
    TokenClient::new(&env, &token_a).transfer(&receiver, &pool, &(amount_a + fee_a));

    true
}
```

## Common mistakes

1. **Forgetting to repay the fee** — Most common; transaction reverts
2. **Reentering the pool** — Triggers `Reentrant` error
3. **Not checking profitability** — Strategy loses money if opportunity closes
4. **Assuming tokens are synchronized** — Fee-on-transfer tokens may deduct more
5. **No deadline/timeout** — Strategy may execute after conditions change
