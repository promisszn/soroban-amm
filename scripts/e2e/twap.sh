# twap.sh — end-to-end flow for the oracle consumers (issue #985):
# save_snapshot through the normal simulate-then-submit path, wait out a
# 60-second window, then read a TWAP (and a TWAL) over it.
#
# Every client (this CLI, the SDKs, examples/python/twap_client.py) simulates
# a transaction against the latest closed ledger and applies it in a later
# one. When snapshots were keyed by the ledger timestamp, the key written at
# apply time was never the key simulation had put in the footprint, so every
# save_snapshot trapped with "trying to access contract data key outside of
# the footprint". Unit tests cannot see that — Env::default() does not
# enforce footprints — so this flow is what guards it.
#
# Uses the shared AMM pool and the consumers from scripts/deploy.sh. Both
# consumers' keeper is the deploy admin, which must be this flow's source
# account.
