# Go SDK for the Soroban AMM

A Go client for the AMM pool contract (`contracts/amm`). Read methods run
through simulation and need no signer; write methods build, simulate, sign,
submit and poll a transaction.

The SDK has **no third-party dependencies** — the ScVal encoding, the strkey
codec and the transaction envelope builder are all in this package, so there is
no `go.sum` to vendor and nothing to audit beyond the standard library.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/promisszn/soroban-amm/packages/go-sdk
```

Requires Go 1.21 or newer.

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"log"
	"math/big"
	"time"

	gosdk "github.com/promisszn/soroban-amm/packages/go-sdk"
)

func main() {
	client, err := gosdk.NewClient(gosdk.Config{
		RPCURL:            "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org",
		NetworkPassphrase: gosdk.NetworkTestnet,
		Timeout:           20 * time.Second,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	ctx := context.Background()
	poolID := "C..."   // the AMM pool contract
	tokenIn := "C..."  // one of the pool's two tokens

	// Read: no signer required.
	quote, err := client.SimulateSwap(ctx, poolID, tokenIn, big.NewInt(10_000_000))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	log.Printf("out=%s fee=%s impact=%s bps",
		quote.AmountOut, quote.FeeAmount, quote.PriceImpactBps)

	// Write: requires Config.Signer, plus an explicit deadline and bound.
	_, err = client.Swap(ctx, gosdk.SwapParams{
		PoolID:   poolID,
		Trader:   "G...",
		TokenIn:  tokenIn,
		AmountIn: big.NewInt(10_000_000),
		MinOut:   minOut, // derive from quote.AmountOut
		Deadline: uint64(time.Now().Add(2 * time.Minute).Unix()),
	})
	if errors.Is(err, gosdk.ErrSlippageExceeded) {
		log.Fatal("price moved; re-quote and retry")
	}
}
```

A complete, commented walkthrough lives in
[`examples/basic_example.go`](examples/basic_example.go).

## Read methods

Every read is a simulation. None of them requires a `Signer`, none submits a
transaction, and none consumes fees.

| Method | Returns |
|--------|---------|
| `GetInfo(ctx, poolID)` | `*PoolInfo` — both tokens, both reserves, total shares, all fee parameters, admin |
| `GetReserves(ctx, poolID)` | `*Reserves` |
| `SimulateSwap(ctx, poolID, tokenIn, amountIn)` | `*SwapQuote` — output, fee, price impact, effective and spot price |
| `GetAmountOut(ctx, poolID, tokenIn, amountIn)` | `*big.Int` |
| `GetAmountIn(ctx, poolID, tokenOut, amountOut)` | `*big.Int` |
| `SharesOf(ctx, poolID, provider)` | `*big.Int` |

`PoolInfo`'s fields mirror the contract's `PoolInfo` struct field for field.

## Write methods

`Swap`, `AddLiquidity` and `RemoveLiquidity` each take a params struct, and
each requires a `Signer`.

**Deadlines and slippage bounds are never defaulted.** A zero `Deadline`
returns `ErrDeadlineRequired` and a nil slippage bound returns
`ErrSlippageRequired`, before any RPC call is made. Both are safety parameters:
a silently-defaulted bound is how a swap gets sandwiched, and a
silently-defaulted deadline is how one sits in the mempool until the price has
moved. A bound of zero is accepted, because that is an explicit decision to
take any price.

Derive the bound from a fresh quote:

```go
quote, _ := client.SimulateSwap(ctx, poolID, tokenIn, amountIn)

// 50 bps of tolerance.
minOut := new(big.Int).Mul(quote.AmountOut, big.NewInt(9_950))
minOut.Div(minOut, big.NewInt(10_000))
```

## Signing

The client never holds a secret key. Supply a `Signer`:

```go
type Signer interface {
	Address() string
	SignEnvelope(ctx context.Context, envelopeXDR, networkPassphrase string) (string, error)
}
```

`SignEnvelope` receives a base64 transaction envelope and returns the signed
envelope. Back it with a local keypair, an HSM, or a remote signing service.
`SignerFunc` adapts a plain function:

```go
signer := gosdk.SignerFunc{
	Addr: "G...",
	Sign: func(ctx context.Context, envelopeXDR, passphrase string) (string, error) {
		return myHSM.Sign(ctx, envelopeXDR, passphrase)
	},
}
```

## Errors

Contract errors decode into typed sentinels, so callers branch with
`errors.Is` rather than matching strings:

```go
switch {
case errors.Is(err, gosdk.ErrSlippageExceeded):  // AmmError #5
case errors.Is(err, gosdk.ErrDeadlineExceeded):  // AmmError #4
case errors.Is(err, gosdk.ErrPaused):            // AmmError #6
case errors.Is(err, gosdk.ErrInsufficientLiquidity): // AmmError #11
}
```

All fifteen `AmmError` discriminants from
[docs/error-codes.md](../../docs/error-codes.md) are mapped. An unrecognised
discriminant still yields a `*ContractError` carrying `Code` and the raw RPC
text, so a new contract error is legible rather than opaque.

Client-side failures have their own sentinels: `ErrInvalidConfig`,
`ErrNoSigner`, `ErrDeadlineRequired`, `ErrSlippageRequired`, `ErrRPC`,
`ErrTransactionFailed`.

## 128-bit integers

The contracts use `i128` for every amount, reserve and share balance. Go has no
native 128-bit integer, so the SDK uses `*big.Int` and range-checks at the
boundary:

```go
parts, err := gosdk.EncodeI128(v)   // ErrI128OutOfRange outside [MinI128, MaxI128]
b, err := gosdk.EncodeI128Bytes(v)  // 16-byte big-endian two's complement
s, err := gosdk.EncodeI128Base64(v) // as carried by JSON-RPC
```

An out-of-range value is **rejected, never truncated** — a truncated amount is
a different transaction, and it would fail on-chain or, worse, succeed for the
wrong number.

## Transport

Override the HTTP client to control transport, proxying and timeouts:

```go
client = client.WithHTTPClient(&http.Client{Timeout: 45 * time.Second})
client = client.WithPolling(2*time.Second, 60) // getTransaction backoff and budget
```

## Testing

```sh
go build ./... && go vet ./... && gofmt -l . && go test ./... -count=1
```

The suite runs entirely against `httptest` servers returning recorded RPC
responses. No test touches the network. CI runs the same four commands.

## Scope

This SDK covers the AMM pool. Governance, staking and concentrated-liquidity
clients are not implemented here.
