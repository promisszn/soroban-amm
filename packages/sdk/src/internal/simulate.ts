/**
 * Shared read-only simulation helper for every typed SDK client — Issue #831.
 *
 * Soroban read-only simulation does not need a real, funded source account: the
 * RPC server never checks the source account's existence or sequence number when
 * simulating. Building the envelope around a locally-constructed `Account`
 * therefore avoids both a needless network round-trip and a hard dependency on
 * the dummy account existing on the target network (testnet/futurenet/a fresh
 * local node).
 *
 * Previously each of the five clients inlined its own copy of this helper and
 * fetched a hardcoded source account via `server.getAccount(...)`. That
 * hardcoded string was 55 characters — one short of a valid 56-character
 * Stellar strkey — so it failed strkey decoding and made every read call throw.
 * Keeping the helper in one place prevents that kind of drift from recurring.
 */
