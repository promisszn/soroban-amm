//! Shared cross-contract call interfaces for `amm`, `factory`, and
//! `concentrated_liquidity`.
//!
//! `router`, `dex-aggregator`, `batch_router`, and `batch_auction` each need
//! to call into more than one of those pools/registries, but must not depend
//! on their crates directly: every `#[contractimpl]` fn in a dependency is
//! exported as a wasm symbol, so linking two contract crates' functions into
//! one wasm module collides on every shared entry-point name (e.g.
//! `accept_admin`, `is_paused`). This crate has no `#[contract]` /
//! `#[contractimpl]` block and produces no wasm exports of its own — it only
//! declares the subset of each pool's interface that callers actually invoke,
//! via `#[contractclient]`, plus the plain data types those calls exchange.
//!
//! Soroban resolves cross-contract errors and struct fields by their
//! `#[contracterror]`/`#[contracttype]` discriminant and field names encoded
//! on the wire, not by Rust type identity, so these declarations only need to
//! stay in sync with the real contracts' public signatures — they do not need
//! to be the same Rust type.
