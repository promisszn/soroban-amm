//! Fuzz / property-based tests for AMM swap invariants.
//!
//! This crate contains **two complementary suites**:
//!
//! ## 1. Pure-formula suite (fast, no Soroban environment)
//!
//! The top-level `proptest!` block and the `regression` module verify the
//! constant-product formula helpers (`cp_amount_out`, `fee_amount`,
//! `SimPool`) in isolation. These run tens of thousands of cases cheaply
//! because they never touch an actual contract.
//!
//! Verifies:
//!   1. The x*y=k invariant holds (k never decreases) after every swap.
//!   2. Fee calculations are correct across all valid fee tiers (0–10 000 bps).
//!   3. No integer overflow or rounding error causes incorrect output.
//!   4. The constant-product output formula never returns a value ≥ reserve_out.
//!
//! ## 2. Deployed-contract suite (`contract_props` module)
//!
//! The `contract_props` module deploys the **real** `amm.wasm` and
//! `token.wasm` binaries (via `soroban_sdk::contractimport!`) into a
//! Soroban test environment and drives `Pool::client` directly.  It
//! verifies the same invariants against the on-chain code so that
//! defects in the actual contract logic (e.g. in `swap`, `add_liquidity`,
//! or `swap_fot`) are caught here even if the pure-formula suite passes.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo test -p amm-fuzz
//!
//! Each proptest property runs with 256 cases by default in the
//! deployed-contract suite (Soroban environments are heavier to spin up)
//! and 10 000 cases in the pure-formula suite.
