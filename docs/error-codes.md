# Error codes


This document provides a complete reference for every error code emitted by the
Soroban AMM contracts across all contract crates in `contracts/`. For each code you will find:

- **Numeric code** – the on-chain discriminant embedded in the XDR `InvokeHostFunctionResult` when the contract returns that error.
- **Symbol** – the symbolic name in Rust source and decoded XDR.
- **Cause** – what precondition guard was violated in the contract code.
- **Remedy** – actionable instructions for the caller to recover.

Use the numeric code when parsing RPC responses or writing off-chain tooling.

| 2 | PoolAlreadyExists | A pool for the pair already exists |
| 3 | PoolNotFound | Pool lookup failed |
| 4 | UnknownPool | The pool address is not a factory-deployed pool |
| 5 | LabelTooLong | Metadata label exceeds 64 bytes |
| 6 | InvalidOffset | Offset beyond the available pool list |

## Oracle Aggregator (`contracts/oracle_aggregator`)

Defined in [contracts/oracle_aggregator/src/lib.rs](../contracts/oracle_aggregator/src/lib.rs) as `OracleError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` was called on an already-initialized aggregator. | Deploy a new aggregator contract. |
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | A function was called before `initialize`. | Call `initialize` first. |
| 3 | `NotAdmin` | The caller did not match the stored admin address. | Use the correct admin keypair. |
| 4 | `SourceAlreadyRegistered` | `register_source` was called with an address already in the registry. | Remove and re-register, or use a different address. |
| 5 | `SourceNotFound` | `remove_source` or `set_source_weight` referenced an unknown address. | Check `list_sources()` for registered addresses. |
| 6 | `InsufficientSources` | Fewer than `MIN_VALID_SOURCES` fresh, agreeing sources were available, or `get_price` was called with insufficient confidence. | Register more sources or widen the deviation band. |
| 7 | `InvalidStaleness` | `max_staleness_seconds` was zero. | Use a positive value. |
| 8 | `InvalidDeviation` | `max_deviation_bps` was zero or exceeded `BPS_DENOMINATOR` (10 000). | Use a value in `1..=10_000`. |
| 9 | `InvalidWeight` | A source weight was zero or exceeded `MAX_SOURCE_WEIGHT` (100 000). | Use a value in `1..=100_000`. |
| 10 | `WeightFloorNotMet` | The total agreeing weight was below `MIN_AGREEING_WEIGHT` (20 000). | Increase individual source weights or register more sources. |

> **ABI change (#689):** `AggregatedPrice.confidence` is now the **summed weight**
> of agreeing sources (not a raw count). A source with weight 10 000 contributes
> 10 000 to confidence, not 1. This is a breaking change for off-chain consumers
> that interpreted `confidence` as a source count.

## Governance


Defined in [contracts/amm/src/lib.rs](../contracts/amm/src/lib.rs) as `AmmError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` (or `initialize_with_flash_loan_fee`) was called on a pool that has already been set up. The presence of `DataKey::TokenA` in instance storage is the guard. | Deploy a fresh pool contract instead of re-initializing. |
| 2 | `InvalidFeeBps` | A fee value was outside `[0, 10 000]` bps, or `protocol_fee_bps` exceeded `fee_bps`, or `new_fee_bps` was below the current `protocol_fee_bps`. | Ensure `0 ≤ protocol_fee_bps ≤ fee_bps ≤ 10 000`. |
| 3 | `InsufficientShares` | The LP share burn amount in `remove_liquidity` exceeded the provider's actual LP token balance. | Query `shares_of(provider)` first and cap the burn amount to that value. |
| 4 | `DeadlineExceeded` | The `deadline` ledger timestamp passed before the transaction was included. | Re-submit with `deadline = current_ledger_timestamp + buffer`. |
| 5 | `SlippageExceeded` | For swaps: `amount_out < min_out` or `required_in > max_in`. For `add_liquidity`: minted shares < `min_shares`. For `remove_liquidity`: `out_a < min_a` or `out_b < min_b`. | Widen slippage bounds or use `simulate_swap` / `get_amount_in` to recalculate before submitting. |
| 6 | `Paused` | The pool has been administratively paused via `pause()`. All state-mutating functions (swap, add/remove liquidity, flash loan) reject calls while paused. | Wait for the admin (or governance) to call `unpause()`. |
| 7 | `Unauthorized` | A caller passed an `admin` address that does not match the stored admin. | Use the correct admin keypair. The current admin can be read with `get_info().admin`. |
| 8 | `ZeroAmount` | An `amount_*` argument was zero or negative (`amount <= 0`). | Pass a strictly positive value. |
| 9 | `InvalidToken` | `token_in`, `token_out`, or `token` did not match either of the two pool tokens. | Use `get_info()` to discover valid token addresses. |
| 10 | `EmptyPool` | A swap or `price_ratio` was attempted on a pool where at least one reserve is zero. | Add liquidity before trading. |
| 11 | `InsufficientLiquidity` | Either `amount_out ≥ reserve_out` (would drain the pool), or `reserve < amount` for a flash loan, or the flash loan receiver did not repay (`balance_after < balance_before + fee`). | Reduce the trade/loan size, or ensure the flash loan receiver repays the principal plus fee within the callback. |
| 12 | `NoPendingAdmin` | `accept_admin` was called when no admin transfer is in progress. | Call `propose_admin` first to nominate a successor. |
| 13 | `WrongAdmin` | `accept_admin` was called by an address that does not match the pending nominee. | Have the correct address (the one passed to `propose_admin`) call `accept_admin`. |
| 14 | `Reentrant` | A reentrant call was made into any fund-moving entry point — `swap`, `swap_exact_out`, `swap_fot`, `add_liquidity`, `add_liquidity_fot`, `remove_liquidity`, `remove_liquidity_one_sided`, `flash_loan`, `withdraw_protocol_fees`, or `emergency_withdraw` — while the pool-wide reentrancy lock (`DataKey::Locked`) was already held. Most commonly this is a flash-loan receiver's `on_flash_loan` callback calling back into the pool, or a malicious/fee-on-transfer token's `transfer` implementation calling back into the pool mid-swap. | Do not call any of the functions above from inside `on_flash_loan` or a token's own `transfer`/`transfer_from`. Perform all swaps and liquidity operations *before* or *after* the flash loan, not during the callback. Query `is_locked()` (formerly `flash_loan_locked()`, kept as a deprecated alias) to check whether the lock is currently held. If the lock is ever stranded, the admin (or, when a multisig is configured, `quorum` of its signers) can clear it with `force_unlock`. |
| 15 | `CircuitBreaker` | The spot price deviated more than the configured threshold (default 5 000 bps = 50 %) from the value at the start of the block. The pool has been automatically paused. | Wait for the cooldown period to elapse (default 600 s) and call `try_circuit_breaker_recovery`, or have governance call `unpause`. |
| 16 | `FotSlippage` | A fee-on-transfer token deducted fees resulting in fewer tokens received than the `min_received` guard (`received < min_received`). | Widen `min_received` threshold or trade using standard non-FoT tokens. |
| 17 | `OracleDeviationExceeded` | Spot price deviated beyond configured oracle tolerance (`\|spot - oracle\| > max_deviation`). | Retry when spot price or oracle price stabilizes within configured tolerance. |
| 18 | `FlashLoanRepaymentFailed` | Receiver contract failed to return borrowed tokens plus fee (`balance_after < balance_before + fee`). | Ensure `on_flash_loan` callback repays principal and fee in full. |
| 19 | `AlreadyExecuted` | Emergency withdrawal multisig proposal was already executed (`proposal.executed == true`). | No action required; proposal has already been executed. |
| 20 | `ProposalExpired` | Emergency withdrawal multisig proposal exceeded its validity window (`now > proposal.expires_at`). | Submit a new emergency withdrawal proposal. |

## AmmSdk (`contracts/amm-sdk`)

Defined in [contracts/amm-sdk/src/types.rs](../contracts/amm-sdk/src/types.rs) as `SdkAmmError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called on a pool that is already set up. | Deploy a fresh pool contract instead. |
| 2 | `InvalidFeeBps` | Fee outside `[0, 10 000]` bps or protocol fee > swap fee. | Use a value in the accepted range. |
| 3 | `InsufficientShares` | LP burn amount exceeds caller's balance. | Reduce `shares` to ≤ `shares_of(provider)`. |
| 4 | `DeadlineExceeded` | `deadline` ledger timestamp already passed. | Re-submit with a future deadline. |
| 5 | `SlippageExceeded` | Output or input violated the slippage guard. | Widen `min_out` / `max_in` or retry later. |
| 6 | `Paused` | Pool is administratively paused. | Wait for admin to call `unpause`. |
| 7 | `Unauthorized` | Caller does not match stored admin. | Use correct admin keypair. |
| 8 | `ZeroAmount` | Amount argument is zero or negative. | Pass a positive value. |
| 9 | `InvalidToken` | `token_in`/`token_out` is not a pool token. | Use `pool.get_info()` to discover valid tokens. |
| 10 | `EmptyPool` | One or both reserves are zero. | Add liquidity before trading. |
| 11 | `InsufficientLiquidity` | Output ≥ reserve or flash loan not repaid. | Reduce trade size or ensure repayment. |
| 12 | `NoPendingAdmin` | `accept_admin` called without a prior `propose_admin`. | Call `propose_admin` first. |
| 13 | `WrongAdmin` | `accept_admin` caller ≠ pending nominee. | Have correct address call `accept_admin`. |
| 14 | `Reentrant` | Reentrant call detected during flash loan callback. | Do not call pool functions from `on_flash_loan`. |
| 15 | `CircuitBreaker` | Price moved > threshold, pool auto-paused. | Wait for cooldown or governance action. |
| 16 | `FotSlippage` | Fee-on-transfer token deducted more than `min_received`. | Widen `min_received` or use non-FoT token. |
| 17 | `OracleDeviationExceeded` | Spot price deviated beyond oracle tolerance. | Retry when oracle price stabilises. |
| 18 | `FlashLoanRepaymentFailed` | Receiver did not repay borrowed amounts + fees. | Ensure `on_flash_loan` repays in full. |
| 19 | `AlreadyExecuted` | Multisig emergency withdrawal was already executed. | No action — proposal already carried out. |
| 20 | `ProposalExpired` | Multisig emergency withdrawal proposal has expired. | Submit a new proposal. |

## BatchAuction (`contracts/batch_auction`)

Defined in [contracts/batch_auction/src/lib.rs](../contracts/batch_auction/src/lib.rs) as `AuctionError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called on an already configured auction contract instance. | Deploy a fresh batch auction contract instance. |
| 2 | `Unauthorized` | Action invoked by caller other than the registered admin or keeper. | Call method using the stored admin or keeper credentials. |
| 3 | `OrderNotFound` | Order lookup failed for the provided `order_id`. | Query active orders using `get_order` to verify ID before cancelling or modifying. |
| 4 | `BatchWindowOpen` | Settlement or clearing attempted while the batch submission window is still open. | Wait until batch submission deadline elapses before executing settlement. |
| 5 | `NoOrders` | Batch clearing executed with zero orders in the current batch queue. | Submit orders to the batch before initiating clearing. |
| 6 | `ZeroAmount` | Order amount supplied was zero or negative (`amount <= 0`). | Provide a strictly positive order amount. |
| 7 | `DeadlineExceeded` | Order submission timestamp exceeded order deadline. | Submit order with a future deadline. |
| 8 | `BatchFull` | Number of orders in batch reached `max_orders` capacity limit. | Wait for the next batch window or increase `max_orders` configuration. |
| 9 | `InvalidMaxOrders` | `max_orders` set to 0 or above `MAX_ORDERS_CEILING` (200). | Configure `max_orders` within valid `1..=200` range. |
| 10 | `InvalidPoolTokenPair` | Specified `(token_in, token_out)` pair does not match the auction pool's token pair. | Pass token addresses matching the configured pool tokens. |
| 11 | `TransferFailed` | Token transfer to/from trader failed during deposit or payout. | Verify token balance and allowance before placing order. |
| 12 | `NoPendingAdmin` | `accept_admin` called without a prior `propose_admin`. | Call `propose_admin` first to set nominee. |
| 13 | `WrongAdmin` | `accept_admin` called by address other than the nominated pending admin. | Invoke `accept_admin` from the nominee address. |
| 14 | `UnknownVenue` | `pool`/`alt_pool` is neither on the admin allowlist (`add_venue`) nor attested to by the configured factory. | Deploy through the factory, or ask the admin to `add_venue` it. |
| 15 | `VenueRemoved` | Internal: an order's venue was removed from the registry between submission and settlement. | No action — the order is refunded automatically at settlement. |
| 16 | `DeadlineTooFar` | `deadline` is further in the future than `MAX_ORDER_LIFETIME_SECS` (7 days). | Submit with a nearer deadline. |
| 17 | `OrderNotExpired` | `expire_order` called on an order whose deadline has not passed yet. | Wait until the order's deadline, or use `cancel_order` instead. |
| 18 | `NothingToClaim` | `claim_refund` called for an order with no claimable balance on record. | No action — nothing was stranded for this order. |

---

## BatchRouter (`contracts/batch_router`)

Defined in [contracts/batch_router/src/lib.rs](../contracts/batch_router/src/lib.rs) as `BatchRouterError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called on a batch router that already has a `DataKey::Factory` set. | Deploy a fresh batch router contract instance. |
| 2 | `EmptyBatch` | `execute_batch`, `simulate_batch`, or `validate_batch` called with an empty operations array. | Provide at least one batch operation. |
| 3 | `BatchTooLarge` | `ops.len()` exceeds `MAX_BATCH_OPS` (200), the ceiling returned by `max_batch_ops`. | Split the batch into multiple calls, each within the ceiling. |
| 4 | `DeadlineExpired` | `env.ledger().timestamp() > deadline` at batch time. | Re-submit the batch with a future deadline. |
| 5 | `InvalidAmount` | A `Swap`/`AddLiquidity`/`RemoveLiquidity` op carried a non-positive `amount_in`/`amount_a`/`amount_b`/`shares`. | Ensure every op amount is strictly positive. |
| 6 | `PoolNotFound` | An op named a pool the configured factory does not recognize (`get_pool_tokens` returned `None`). | Target only pools registered with the batch router's factory. |
| 7 | `SlippageExceeded` | The simulated or executed output/shares fell below the op's `min_out`/`min_shares`/`min_a`/`min_b` guard. | Loosen the slippage guard or resubmit against fresher pool state. |

## ClPositionNft (`contracts/cl_position_nft`)

Defined in [contracts/cl_position_nft/src/lib.rs](../contracts/cl_position_nft/src/lib.rs) as `NftError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called on an already configured NFT contract. | Deploy a fresh NFT contract. |
| 2 | `Unauthorized` | Restricted method called by non-admin or unauthorized address. | Invoke function using admin or registered CL pool credentials. |
| 3 | `TokenNotFound` | Operation referenced a non-existent or burned `token_id`. | Query existing tokens using `owner_of` to confirm `token_id`. |
| 4 | `NotOwnerOrApproved` | Transfer or burn attempted by caller who is neither token owner nor approved operator. | Execute call from owner account or approve operator via `approve`. |
| 5 | `InvalidReceiver` | Safe transfer target contract rejected token reception or failed check. | Ensure target contract implements `on_nft_received` hook. |
| 6 | `InvalidTtlConfig` | TTL parameters outside acceptable limits. | Provide valid TTL duration values. |

---

## ConcentratedLiquidity (`contracts/concentrated_liquidity`)

Defined in [contracts/concentrated_liquidity/src/lib.rs](../contracts/concentrated_liquidity/src/lib.rs) as `ClError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called on an already-configured pool. | Deploy a new pool. |
| 2 | `TokensMustDiffer` | `token_a == token_b` during initialization. | Use two distinct token addresses. |
| 3 | `InvalidFeeBps` | Fee outside `[0, 10 000]` bps. | Use a value in the accepted range. |
| 4 | `TickOutOfRange` | A tick value was outside `[-MAX_TICK, MAX_TICK]` (±887 272). `lower_tick` must also be < `upper_tick`. | Keep ticks inside the valid range and ensure lower < upper. |
| 5 | `ZeroAmounts` | Both `amount_a_desired` and `amount_b_desired` were zero or negative. | Provide at least one positive desired amount. |
| 6 | `SlippageExceeded` | `amount_a < min_a` or `amount_b < min_b` on `mint_position`, or output below `min_out` on `swap`. | Widen slippage bounds. |
| 7 | `ZeroLiquidity` | Computed liquidity for a new position was zero (amounts too small relative to the price range). | Increase the deposit amounts or narrow the tick range. |
| 8 | `InsufficientLiquidity` | `burn_position` requested more liquidity than the position holds, or swap output would exceed available liquidity. | Burn ≤ `position.liquidity`; reduce swap size. |
| 9 | `PositionNotFound` | `collect_fees`, `burn_position`, or `collect_all` referenced a position `(owner, lower_tick, upper_tick)` that does not exist. | Verify the position exists with `get_position` before operating on it. |
| 10 | `DeadlineExpired` | The `deadline` timestamp passed before execution. | Re-submit with a future deadline. |
| 11 | `Paused` | Pool is paused. | Wait for admin to unpause. |
| 12 | `Unauthorized` | Admin mismatch. | Use the stored admin address. |
| 13 | `TickNotAligned` | A tick was not a multiple of `tick_spacing`. | Round ticks to the nearest multiple of `tick_spacing`. |
| 14 | `InvalidTickSpacing` | `tick_spacing ≤ 0` during initialization. | Use a positive tick spacing (common values: 1, 10, 60, 200). |
| 15 | `TickNotInitialized` | A swap crossed into a tick that has no liquidity (never been used by any position). | Ensure positions cover the full swap range, or use a smaller swap amount. |
| 16 | `InvalidToken` | `token_in` is not `token_a` or `token_b`. | Check `get_info()` for valid token addresses. |
| 17 | `RangeOrderInRange` | `place_range_order` called when current tick is inside `[lower_tick, upper_tick)`. | Select a tick range strictly above or below current tick. |
| 18 | `OracleDeviationExceeded` | Spot price deviated beyond configured oracle tolerance during swap. | Wait for oracle price to stabilize or adjust tolerance. |
| 19 | `NftNotConfigured` | Tokenization attempted when no NFT contract address is set in storage. | Call `set_nft_contract` with a valid position NFT contract. |
| 20 | `NotNftOwner` | Caller is not current owner of position NFT. | Call method from NFT owner account. |
| 21 | `NftContractChangeBlocked` | Admin attempted NFT contract change while tokenized positions exist. | Untokenize/burn active position NFTs before changing contract. |
| 22 | `RangeOrderExists` | Range order already active on specified range for caller. | Withdraw existing range order before placing a new one. |
| 23 | `ExactOutNotFullyFilled` | `swap_exact_out` or `quote_exact_out` (#696) could not fill the requested `amount_out` in full before running out of initialized ticks or hitting `sqrt_price_limit_x96`. Exact-out has no meaningful partial fill. | Reduce `amount_out`, widen `sqrt_price_limit_x96`, or add liquidity to the range being traded against. |

`swap_exact_out(env, sender, zero_for_one, amount_out, sqrt_price_limit_x96,
max_amount_in, deadline)` (#696) is the mirror of `swap`: it fixes the
*output* amount instead of the input, reverting with `SlippageExceeded` if
the required input exceeds `max_amount_in` and with
`ExactOutNotFullyFilled` on a partial fill. `quote_exact_out(env,
zero_for_one, amount_out, sqrt_price_limit_x96)` is a read-only simulation
sharing the same tick-walking core, so it can never disagree with what
`swap_exact_out` actually charges on the same pool state.

## DexAggregator (`contracts/dex_aggregator`)

Defined in [contracts/dex_aggregator/src/lib.rs](../contracts/dex_aggregator/src/lib.rs) as `AggregatorError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `NoRouteFound` | No valid liquidity route connects `token_in` and `token_out` across registered pools. | Provide connected intermediate pools or update route path. |
| 2 | `SlippageExceeded` | Total output across aggregated swap steps fell below `min_amount_out`. | Widen slippage tolerance or update quote before submitting. |
| 3 | `UnregisteredPool` | A route hop references a pool that is not registered with the factory. | Only route through pools registered via the factory. |
| 4 | `InvalidMaxHops` | `set_max_hops` called with `0`. | Pass a positive hop count. |
| 5 | `TooManyRoutingTokens` | `set_routing_tokens` called with more than `MAX_ROUTING_TOKENS` addresses. | Reduce the routing token list size. |

---

## TwalConsumer (`contracts/twal_consumer`)

Defined in [contracts/twal_consumer/src/lib.rs](../contracts/twal_consumer/src/lib.rs) as `TwalError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called twice. | Deploy a new consumer contract. |
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | `get_keeper` (and thus keeper-gated calls) invoked before `initialize`. | Call `initialize` first. |
| 3 | `ZeroWindow` | `window_seconds` was `0` on `get_twal_liquidity` or a batch read. | Pass a positive window. |
| 4 | `InsufficientHistory` | The ledger has not yet advanced past `window_seconds`, so `now - window` would underflow. | Wait until `ledger_timestamp >= window_seconds`, or use a shorter window. |
| 5 | `NoSnapshotFound` | No `save_snapshot`/`save_cl_snapshot` was recorded at exactly `now - window_seconds`. | Snapshot on a fixed cadence that lines up with the windows you intend to query. |
| 6 | `ElapsedZero` | The pool's own timestamp did not advance between the snapshot and now (no liquidity-changing operation occurred). | Query a window in which the pool actually transacted. |
| 7 | `TooManyTrackedPools` | `add_tracked_pool`, or implicit registration inside `save_snapshot`/`save_cl_snapshot`, would grow the tracked set past `MAX_TRACKED_POOLS` (100). | Call `remove_tracked_pool` on a stale pool first, or track fewer pools. |
| 8 | `NotTracked` | `remove_tracked_pool` was called with a pool that is not currently tracked. | Check `is_tracked` before removing. |
| 9 | `WindowTooLarge` | `window_seconds` exceeded `MAX_WINDOW_SECONDS` (90 days). | Use a shorter window. |
| 10 | `TooManyPools` | `get_twal_batch` was called with more pools than `MAX_TRACKED_POOLS`. | Split the request into smaller batches. |
| 11 | `CrossContractCallFailed` | A pool's liquidity-oracle call failed at the host level or the callee panicked (non-contract address, buggy pool). Only ever appears as a `TwalEntry.error_code` from `get_twal_all_safe`/`get_twal_batch`, or as the `Err` from `get_twal_all` once any entry fails this way. | Investigate the specific pool with `get_twal_batch([pool], window)`; consider `remove_tracked_pool` if it is permanently dead. |

`get_twal_all_safe` and `get_twal_batch` never return an `Err` for a single bad
pool — they return a `TwalEntry` with `ok: false` and `error_code` set to one
of the codes above instead, so a single dead pool cannot take down a batch
read. `get_twal_all` is kept on the ABI for existing callers and still
surfaces the first such code as a typed `Err`.

## Factory (`contracts/factory`)

Defined in [contracts/factory/src/lib.rs](../contracts/factory/src/lib.rs) as `FactoryError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called twice. | Only initialize the factory once after deployment. |
| 2 | `InvalidFeeBps` | Fee outside `[0, 10 000]`. | Correct the fee value. |
| 3 | `PoolAlreadyExists` | `create_pool` was called for a `(token_a, token_b)` pair that already has an AMM pool. | Use `get_pool` to retrieve the existing pool address. |
| 4 | `ClPoolAlreadyExists` | `create_cl_pool` was called for a pair/fee that already has a CL pool. | Use `get_cl_pool` to retrieve the existing address. |
| 5 | `ClWasmNotSet` | Tried to create a CL pool before the CL WASM hash was registered via `set_cl_wasm`. | Call `set_cl_wasm` with the uploaded CL contract hash first. |
| 6 | `Unauthorized` | Non-admin called an admin-only factory function. | Use the factory admin keypair. |
| 7 | `FeeNotConfigured` | Attempted pool creation with unconfigured or invalid fee tier. | Use a configured fee tier (e.g., 1, 5, 30, 100 bps). |
| 8 | `RateLimitExceeded` | Pool creation rate limit reached for current epoch. | Wait for rate limit window to reset. |
| 9 | `CreationPaused` | Admin administratively paused pool creation. | Wait for admin to unpause creation. |

## ClPositionNft (`contracts/cl_position_nft`)

Defined in [contracts/cl_position_nft/src/lib.rs](../contracts/cl_position_nft/src/lib.rs) as `NftError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called twice. | Deploy a new NFT contract instead. |
| 2 | `Unauthorized` | A caller other than the registered `cl_pool` called `mint`/`burn`, or `set_ttl_params`/`migrate_ownership_index` was called by a non-admin (or before `initialize`). | Use the registered pool address (for mint/burn) or the admin address (for the others). |
| 3 | `TokenNotFound` | `owner_of`, `position_meta`, `burn`, `approve`, or `transfer` referenced a `token_id` that does not exist (never minted, or already burned). | Verify the id with `owner_of`/`total_supply` first. |
| 4 | `NotOwnerOrApproved` | `transfer` called by an address that is neither the token's owner, its approved address, nor an approved operator for the owner. | Use the owner, an approved address, or an approved operator. |
| 5 | `InvalidReceiver` | Reserved; not currently returned by any function. | — |
| 6 | `InvalidTtlConfig` | `set_ttl_params` was called with `bump_to < min_ttl_threshold`. | Ensure `bump_to >= min_ttl_threshold`. |
| 7 | `TooManyPositions` | `mint` (or the `to` side of `transfer`) would push an owner's O(1)-indexed holdings past `MAX_POSITIONS_PER_OWNER` (10,000). Defence in depth introduced in #697, on top of the O(1) index fix itself. | Transfer or burn existing positions for that owner first. |

#697 replaced the single unbounded `OwnedTokens(owner) -> Vec<u64>` per-owner
list with a constant-cost index (`OwnerTokenCount`, `OwnerTokenByIndex`,
`TokenIndexOfOwner`), so `mint`, `burn`, and `transfer` each touch a fixed
number of storage entries regardless of how many positions an owner holds.
`balance_of`, `tokens_of`, `tokens_of_paginated`, and
`token_of_owner_by_index` read only that index. A legacy `OwnedTokens`
vector from before this upgrade is not written to again — `burn` and the
"from" side of `transfer` fall back to an O(n) removal from it only when a
token has no index slot, and the admin-only `migrate_ownership_index` moves
a legacy vector into the index in bounded chunks. See the "#697: ownership
index" doc comment in `cl_position_nft/src/lib.rs` for the full design and
its trade-offs.

## Governance (`contracts/governance`)

Defined in [contracts/governance/src/lib.rs](../contracts/governance/src/lib.rs) as `GovernanceError`.

| Code | Symbol | Cause | Remedy |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | Governance initialized twice. | Deploy a new governance contract. |

## Decoding errors from RPC responses

When `stellar-sdk-rs` (or the Soroban RPC) returns a failed invocation, the
result contains an XDR `ScError` with kind `Contract` and a `code` field. Map
the code to the table above using the contract address to identify which enum
applies.

```rust
// Pseudocode — adapt to your stellar-sdk-rs version
match result {
    InvocationResult::Err(ScError::Contract(code)) => {
        match contract_address {
            addr if addr == amm_pool => AmmError::from(code),
            addr if addr == cl_pool  => ClError::from(code),
            addr if addr == factory  => FactoryError::from(code),
            _ => eprintln!("unknown contract error {code}"),
        }
    }
    _ => {}
}
```

All error codes are stable across minor contract upgrades. A code is only
ever removed or renumbered in a major version bump accompanied by a migration
guide in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Keeping documentation in sync

Error code definitions live alongside the contract source. To run automated verification of documentation sync across all `#[contracterror]` enums:

```bash
make check-docs
```

Or execute the check script directly:

```bash
bash scripts/check_error_docs.sh
```

CI automatically runs `make check-docs` on every pull request and push to prevent documentation drift.
